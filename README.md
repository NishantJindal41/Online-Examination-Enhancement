Online Exams System fulfills the requirements of the institutes to conduct the exams online. They do not have to go to any software developer to make a separate site for being able to conduct exams online. They just have to register on the site and enter the exam details and the lists of the students which can appear in the exam. Students can give exam without the need of going to any physical destination. They can view the result at the same time. Thus the purpose of the site is to provide a system that saves the efforts and time of both the Institutes and the students.
